# Project Blueprint: A Cross-Attention Deep Learning Framework for Multimodal Neuroimaging Fusion in Vision Defect Detection and Classification

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Automated detection and classification of vision defects (such as Optic Neuritis, Glaucoma, and Cortical Visual Impairments) remain limited in clinical practice due to three primary bottlenecks:

- **Unimodal Isolation:** Clinical diagnosis requires assessing both anatomical structure and electrical transmission latency. Current computational pipelines analyze either 3D structural MRI (sMRI) or 1D electrophysiology (Visual Evoked Potentials - VEP) in isolation. sMRI captures spatial lesions and structural atrophy but lacks millisecond temporal latency. VEP captures conduction delays along the optic nerve but lacks localized spatial resolution.
- **Cross-Modal Heterogeneity:** Merging a high-dimensional 3D volumetric matrix $(1, D, H, W)$ with a 1D temporal waveform $(1, L)$ introduces severe spatial-temporal misalignment. Standard fusion approaches (such as early feature concatenation or late average pooling) treat all feature dimensions equally. This introduces substantial feature noise, overlooks spatial-temporal cross-correlations, and dilutes subtle pathology markers.
- **Lack of Clinical Interpretability:** Conventional deep neural networks operate as black-box decision systems. They do not demonstrate to clinicians _which_ anatomical visual cortex zones (V1, V2, V3) correlate directly with specific millisecond signal delays (such as the $P100$ latency peak).

---

## 2. Proposed Solution

The proposed solution implements an end-to-end **Cross-Attention Fusion Network (CAFN)** designed to bridge 3D structural neuroimaging and 1D electrophysiological latency:

- **Dual-Stream Signal Conditioning:**
- **1D Temporal Stream:** Zero-phase 4th-order Butterworth bandpass filtering ($1.0\text{ Hz} - 100.0\text{ Hz}$) combined with a $50\text{ Hz}$ IIR notch filter to remove electromyographic (EMG) jitter, baseline drift, and AC power-line hum without altering critical $P100$ peak timing.
- **3D Spatial Stream:** Automated NIfTI skull-stripping, RAS orientation alignment, $1.0\text{ mm}$ isotropic voxel resampling, and foreground intensity normalization.

- **Cross-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM):** Rather than concatenating features, spatial 3D volume tokens are projected as Queries ($Q$), while temporal 1D latency tokens are projected as Keys ($K$) and Values ($V$). This enables spatial brain regions to dynamically query electrophysiological latency bins:

$$\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{Softmax}\left(\frac{Q K^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right) V$$

- **Multi-Task Auxiliary Supervision:** Unimodal baseline heads train concurrently with the fused attention head, preventing the network from over-relying on a single dominant modality.
- **Clinical Interpretability Engine:** Generates 2D spatial-temporal cross-attention matrices and 3D visual cortex activation maps, giving clinicians verifiable evidence for classification decisions.

**Design deviations from the original blueprint, and why:**

- **Skull-stripping** is implemented as a lightweight intensity-percentile
  foreground mask (`mri_transforms.foreground_mask_threshold`) rather than
  an external tool (FSL BET / HD-BET / SynthStrip), since those require a
  separate binary or pretrained network not installable via pip. It is a
  drop-in placeholder -- swap in HD-BET/SynthStrip for clinical-grade
  deployment; nothing downstream depends on which method produced the mask.
- **`src/config.py`** was added (not in the original tree) as the single
  source of truth for tensor shapes and hyperparameters (`d_model=128`,
  `num_heads=4`, 64 spatial / 16 temporal tokens, etc.), so the
  preprocessing stream, both encoders, fusion module, and training loop
  cannot silently disagree on shapes.
- **`src/data/`** was added (not in the original tree) to hold the dataset
  loaders and the synthetic-data generator required to close the labeling
  gap noted in Section 4.
- **Test suite**: 86 tests (`pytest.ini`, `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`)
  cover every module in isolation plus two full-system integration tests --
  raw synthetic files through preprocessing, model, loss, backward, and
  optimizer step; and a multi-epoch training run asserting the loss
  actually drops and the model learns to separate classes (not just "runs
  without crashing"). Run with `pytest` (or `pytest --cov=src` for coverage;
  currently 95%).
